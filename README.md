This crate aims to provide high-level, rust-y bindings for the ENet library.
ENet is a networking library for games that builds on UDP,
offering optional reliability, congestion control, connection-orientation and
other related features. For more information, check out the
[ENet Website](http://enet.bespin.org).

## Status

For now, this library is **alpha**. It builds on the C-bindings for ENet,
the [enet-sys crate](https://github.com/ruabmbua/enet-sys). A lot of the
functionality is there, but not everything. Also, since ENet has
pretty unclear lifetime semantics, you might actually run into cases where
things crash. **In those cases, or when something is missing/not yet in the API,
open a bug report, and I will look into it as soon as possible.**

## Usage

To check what the latest released version is, check on
[https://crates.io/crates/enet](crates.io), or use `cargo add` from 
[cargo edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit) to automatically add a
dependency to the most recent version.

Installation is as simple as adding this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
enet = "0.2.4"
```
