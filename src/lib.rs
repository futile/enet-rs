//! This crate provides high-level bindings for the [ENet](http://enet.bespin.org/) networking library.
//!
//! ENet provides features that are most typically used by games, such as
//! unreliable but sequenced data transfer over UDP. ENet also provides optional
//! reliability, and provides multiple channels over a single connection. For more info see the [ENet website](http://enet.bespin.org/).
//!
//! This crate aims to provide high-level, rust-y binding for the ENet library, based on existing low-level [C-bindings](https://crates.io/crates/enet-sys), so users don't have to deal with ffi.
//!
//! The official ENet documentation and tutorials are a good starting point to
//! working with ENet. Most principles and names should be straight-forward to
//! transfer to this library.
//!
//! # Examples
//! This will initialize ENet and deinitialize it when the `Enet`-instance - and
//! all references to it - are dropped:
//!
//! ```
//! use enet::Enet;
//!
//! // `Enet::new()` initializes ENet when it is first called.
//! let enet = Enet::new().unwrap();
//!
//! // Deinitialization is handled automatically (using Arc).
//! ```
//!
//! Also check out the examples in the code, as well as the examples from the official ENet website and from the enet-sys crate. There are also an example server and client in the `examples` directory on [github](https://github.com/futile/enet-rs).
//!
//! # Thread-safety
//! ENet claims to be "mostly" thread-safe as long as access to individual
//! `Host`-instances is handled in a synchronized manner. This is kind of an
//! unclear statement, but this API tries to follow that as good as possible. So
//! if the rust compilers allows you to send/sync an object between threads, it
//! should be safe to do so.
//!
//! If you used no unsafe code and the library blows up in your face, that is considered a bug. Please report any bug you encounter via [github](https://github.com/futile/enet-rs).
